## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the delivery time for online food orders using machine learning techniques. The goal is to improve the accuracy of delivery time predictions, which in turn enhances customer satisfaction and optimizes operational efficiency for food delivery services.

## Project Structure
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation for predicting food delivery times based on various factors like location, restaurant preparation time, and traffic conditions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for training by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Modeling**: Multiple machine learning models were explored, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests.
- **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical demonstration of using machine learning to tackle a real-world problem in the online food delivery industry. By predicting delivery times, it aims to optimize both customer experience and service efficiency.
